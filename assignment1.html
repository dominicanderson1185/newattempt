  For this I focused on the size what they want you to consider important. They want the most important things to pop so 
  that they are read first.

  <p>
  The spacing is actually interesting. The spacing for the title is extreamly small however the titles all have more spacing on them. I can only assume that 
  the spacing on the name is small because it is well known without advertisement and they want the titles of all videos to be easy to read and stand out above all.

  This focuses on the important things further apart or bringing them closer together. 
  It is putting related items together.
